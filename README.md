# Infinite-Scroll-Unsplash

Created with CodeSandbox

## Description

The goal of this project is to produce the inifinite scroll effect seen in many social media platforms. A loading feature was added at the initial onset of the load. After the first initial onload, the photos load by hitting the Unsplash API and keep loading when users scroll near the bottom of the browser window.

## Needed

In order to get started you will need an Unsplash API Key. In order to get an API key you can create an account here:

Then, create a project and this will give you access to the API Key
